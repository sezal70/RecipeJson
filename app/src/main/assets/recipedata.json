      "description": "Mix the 2 tbsp. of oil and a pinch of salt in the flour. Then knead the flour into a dough with some water. Keep the dough covered with a damp cloth. Pressure cook the minced chicken with some salt, turmeric powder, ginger-garlic paste. Drain the boiled chicken and keep aside. Heat oil and add the minced ginger-garlic to it. Add the sliced onion and fry till it starts becoming pink. Add a pinch of sugar to this. Next, add the chopped spring onions, carrots, cabbage. Fry till the vegetables are cooked. Next add the minced chicken and fry for 3-4 mines. Then add the soya sauce, chilli sauce and tomato sauce and mix well. Season with salt and white pepper powder. Take it off the gas and let it to cool. Next take the dough and make a thin roti out of it. Keep it big. Take a small bowl with sharp edges and cut out equal shapes from this roti. Please ensure that the cut-outs/wrappers are not very small. For packing hold wrapper on one palm, put one tablespoon of chicken mixture in the centre of it and with the other hand bring all edges together to the centre, while making pleats. Pinch and twist the pleats to ensure the absolute closure of the stuffed dumpling. You can also put a tbsp of chicken mixture in a small cut out wrapper and fold it in a semicircle by flattening the edges with a fork. Please ensure absolute closure of the stuffed momo. Heat up a steamer, oil the steamer rack well. (This is critical because it will prevent dumplings from sticking. Arrange uncooked momos in the steamer with some space left between them. Close the lid, and allow steaming until the momos are cooked thoroughly, about 10-15 min. Take the momos off the steamer, and immediately serve with Garlic chutney. You can also deep fry the momos before serving them.",

      "name": "Mongolian Beef and Spring Onions",
      "description": "Heat 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the garlic and ginger until they release their fragrance, about 30 seconds. Pour in the soy sauce, water, and brown sugar. Raise the heat to medium-high, and stir 4 minutes, until the sugar has dissolved and the sauce boils and slightly thickens. Remove sauce from the heat, and set aside.Place the sliced beef into a bowl, and stir the cornstarch into the beef, coating it thoroughly. Allow the beef and cornstarch to sit until most of the juices from the meat have been absorbed by the cornstarch, about 10 minutes. Heat the vegetable oil in a deep-sided skillet or wok to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Shake excess cornstarch from the beef slices, and drop them into the hot oil, a few at a time. Stir briefly, and fry until the edges become crisp and start to brown, about 2 minutes. Remove the beef from the oil with a large slotted spoon, and allow to drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. Pour the oil out of the skillet or wok, and return the pan to medium heat. Return the beef slices to the pan, stir briefly, and pour in the reserved sauce. Stir once or twice to combine, and add the green onions. Bring the mixture to a boil, and cook until the onions have softened and turned bright green, about 2 minutes.",

      "description": "Swaddle tofu in paper napkins and leave in a colander with a heavy weight on it - like a steel saucepan - for about an hour for the water to drain out of it. Cut it into slices, about 1/2-inch thick. Marinate tofu for 30 minutes in a mixture of the ingredients listed for marination. Bake the tofu in an oven at 400 degrees F for about 30 minutes or until it is golden brown on top and quite chewy. If you cut the tofu in big slices, cut it into smaller cubes before adding it to the curry. For the sauce: Heat the oil in a saucepan. Add the mustard seeds and when they sputter, add the curry leaves. Toast for a few seconds and then add the blended chilli and onion paste. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture turns a few shades darker and the water has evaporated. Add the tamarind pulp along with 1 cup water. If the curry is too thick, add more water. Add salt, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat so the sauce simmers. Let it cook for 15 minutes without being covered. Add the tofu cubes and let the sauce simmer for another five minutes. Add the coconut milk and jaggery. Mix well and warm. Turn off the heat and garnish with coriander leaves.",
